# My Friends Database

An app to keep track of your numerous friends all in one place!

## Running the app

Run either:
`npm install`
or
`yarn install`

Once all dependencies are installed, run either:
`npm start`
or
`yarn start`

## Assumptions

Input form can only deal with one friend at a time. Submitting closes the form. The form can add/update many, but currently must be reopened for each friend edit.

Charts created are kind of funny, but show how d3 can display information in graphical form.

This could be much more styled, but I decided to go with mostly base-angular material styling to save time.

In this app, we are assuming weight is in lbs, but this could be expanded based on localization.
